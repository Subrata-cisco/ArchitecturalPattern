 * A complex software design is the product of a committee process and lack a common architectural vision.

 * [Design by Committee come from the domain of software standardization: the Structured Query Language (SQL) and

	/*
	 * Symptoms :
	 * 1. We don't know when to stop.
	 * 2. Are you trying to make a Camel where as Horse functionality is also present.
	 * 3. Are you making your IPhone with gold plating?
	 * 4. Features are added to the specification based on proprietary interests.
	 * 5. Attempt to make everybody happy, to satisfy all of the committee participants by incorporating their ideas.
	 * 6. Design and editing is attempted during meetings with more than five people.
	 * 7. No designated project architect.
	 * 8. The design documentation is voluminous (hundreds or thousands of pages).
	 * 9. Convergence and stability are missing from the requirements and the design.
	 * 10. Bad meeting processes, marked by lack of facilitation or ineffective facilitation. 
	 * 
	 * Remedies :
	 * 1. Everyone should have an equal say and that make decisions democratic.
	 * 2. Lets bring tiger teams, a small group of "experts" in a particular problem domain, 
	 *    organized for the duration of the solution for a specific problem or issue
	 * 3. Divergent[lot of ideas for evaluation], convergent[selecting an idea], and information sharing[telling others how to do it.]. 
	 * 4. Don't refine the architecture where we don't have business value.
