	 *    Symptoms :
	 * 
	 * 1. Is the architecture is feasible from time and cost point of view.
	 * 2. How the component integration will happen.
	 * 3. What are tools/third party libraries to be used.
	 * 4. What is the hardware/memory requirement.
	 * 5. What is the platform on which it will be supported.
	 * 6. How practical that all the above thing will work or it is just an assumption.
	 * 7. We have done it already and it will work again , is this the case ?
	 * 8. Don't be over confident !! It is cricket , the game may change any time until the last ball delivered...
	 * 9. Ignorance of new technologies.

	  *  3. Select/Analyze the views.
	  *  4. Validate the implementation.
